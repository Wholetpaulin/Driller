# Driller
This is a drill themed spaceship platformer game.  The player must use his drill spaceship to destroy all the blocks on each level.
This is the first Unity game I've built from scratch (not following along a tutorial). 

**This project is still in early development. Please check back later!**

### Instructions

1. Click on the designated link: ____LINK_WILL_GO_HERE___  (Wait for game to load up)

2. Steer your ship with **A** and **D** or the arrow keys.

3. Boost your drillship into the blocks with **space**.
